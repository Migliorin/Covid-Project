What does it mean to say a virus mutates or changes ?,"When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit. These changes are called “mutations”. The virus with the new mutation(s) is called a “variant” of the original virus.Some viruses change fast and others more slowly. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, changes more slowly than others viruses such as HIV or influenza viruses. This is in part due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has an internal “proofreading mechanism” which corrects mistakes when it makes copies of itself.Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. Occasionally, they result in a virus variant that is better adapted to its environment compared to the original virus. In that case, it can become dominant in a specific environment. This process of selection of successful variants is called “viral evolution” and this is a natural process all viruses go through.When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit.

Should I be concerned about SARS-CoV-2 changing ?,"It is normal for viruses to change. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, depending on where the changes are located in the virus genetic material, and how these changes affect the virus’ shape or properties, some could potentially impact how it behaves and spreads.If a virus changes so much that it is different from the one that vaccines are designed to combat, or tests to recognize, it may influence how well vaccines and diagnostic tests work. WHO, along with its network of experts, is monitoring changes to the virus so that if such a situation arises, measures can be taken to prevent the spread of that variant.So far, the SARS-CoV-2 has changed very little having no impact on available diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that are in development.It is normal for viruses to change.

What is WHO doing to monitor and understand the changes in SARS-CoV-2 ?,"Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has been working with a global network of expert laboratories around the world to support testing and better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.Research groups from all over the world have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and shared these on public databases, including GISAID. This global collaboration allows scientists to better track the virus and how it is changing.Within WHO’s global laboratory network, we have established a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 Evolution Working Group, which is working to detect new mutations early and assess their possible impact on the virus itself and on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has been working with a global network of expert laboratories around the world to support testing and better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.Research groups from all over the world have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and shared these on public databases, including GISAID.

"How does SARS-CoV-2 change when it infects animals , and what are the implications ?","SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but there is evidence of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals like mink, dogs, domestic cats, lions,tigers and raccoon dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after contact with infected humans.There have been reports of large outbreaks in mink farms in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 can acquire unique changes while infecting minks. It has been observed that these mink variants are able to jump back into humans. Preliminary results suggest that the mink variants infecting humans appear to have the same properties as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Further research is needed to better understand whether these mink variants will be able to provide sustained transmission among humans and could have a negative impact on countermeasures, such as vaccines.WHO works closely with other organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organisation for Animal Health, to evaluate these situations occurring at the animal-human interface.SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but there is evidence of transmission between humans and animals.

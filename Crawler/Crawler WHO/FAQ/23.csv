Why should people wear masks ?,"Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks reduce potential exposure risk from an infected person whether they have symptoms or not. People wearing masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission when worn by a person who is infected.Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including: physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, improving ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more.

See our guidance for more information on the use of personal protective equipment by health care workers.Anyone who is feeling unwell, including people with mild symptoms, such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue. People caring for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside of health facilities.When they cannot guarantee a distance of at least 1 metre from others, medical masks are also recommended for the following groups, as they are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and dying:People aged 60 or over.People of any age with underlying health conditions, including: chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, immunocompromised patients and diabetes mellitus. Non-medical, fabric masksare advised for use by the general public when physical distancing cannot be maintained, as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach, including improving ventilation; cleaning hands; covering sneezes and coughs, and more.Find out more on our main public advice page.Further resources: Read our Q&A on children and masks related to COVID-19 for more information on precautions for younger age groups.

When should masks be worn by the general public ?,"Within wider environments where the virus is spreading, masks should be worn by the general public in settings where it is not possible to maintain at least 1 meter from others. Examples of these settings include indoor locations that are crowded and have poor ventilation, public transport and places of high population density – among others.In enclosed settings, especially where there is poor ventilation, it is also very important to increase the rate of air change, reduce recirculation of air and increase the use of outdoor air. WHO has published Q&As on ventilation and air conditioningfor both thegeneral publicandpeople who manage public spaces and buildings.Within wider environments where the virus is spreading, masks should be worn by the general public in settings where it is not possible to maintain at least 1 meter from others.

"What is the difference between medical masks and respirators , like N95s ?","Medical masks (also known as surgical masks)Composition: Made of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materialsConfigured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle. Available in different thicknesses.Have various levels of fluid-resistance and filtration. Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators - FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99Respirator masks are designed to protect healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size.Medical masks (also known as surgical masks)Composition: Made of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materialsConfigured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle.

Does WHO recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves to prevent transmission of COVID-19 ?,"No, WHO does not recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves. These masks are intended for industrial workers to prevent dust and particles from being breathed in as the valve closes on inhale. However, the valve opens on exhale making it easier to breathe but also allowing any virus to funnel through the valve opening, making the mask ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19.No, WHO does not recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves.

Does WHO recommend the use of gloves in the community to prevent transmission of COVID-19 ?,"No, WHO does not recommend the general use of gloves by people in the community. Instead, in public places, such as supermarkets or public/private buildings, WHO recommends the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit, so people can easily clean their hands. By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and other infections.No, WHO does not recommend the general use of gloves by people in the community.

Why and where health workers should wear medical masks in the context of COVID-19 ?,"Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19.Where COVID-19 is spreading, health workers and caregivers should wear a medical mask in all clinical areas of any medical facility. Masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons: Health workers and caregivers include: doctors, nurses, midwives, medical attendants, cleaners, community health workers, and any others working in clinical areas.Clinical areas of particular importance are: screening/triage and emergency rooms, family physician/GP practices, outpatient departments, COVID-19 dedicated units, obstetrics, haematological, cancer and transplant units, long-term health, community care facilities and residential facilities. This means that in areas where there are patients – any patients – WHO recommends that workers in the health facility wear a medical mask, even if physical distancing can be maintained.Respirator masks are recommended for use where aerosol generating procedures are in place for a suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patient. In these settings, WHO recommends the use of airborne and contact precautions. As there are reports of health workers being infected with COVID-19 outside of health facilities, it is critical that health workers, as all people, follow the guidance to protect themselves from infection when outside of a health facility. Further resources: Healthcare workers can complete our OpenWHO course on how to put on and remove personal protective equipment.Read our guidance on ‘Infection prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease (‎COVID-19)‎ is suspected or confirmed’. WHO first issued interim guidance on recommended practices for health workers caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in January 2020, which included following droplet/contact precautions: surgical gown, gloves, medical mask, and eye protectionHealth workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19.Where COVID-19 is spreading, health workers and caregivers should wear a medical mask in all clinical areas of any medical facility.
